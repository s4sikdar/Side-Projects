These are my first side projects. Here we have the original projects I created back around February. The Expense Tracker file is an expense tracker that I created, that stores 
an excel file to your computer to then tell you the current balance. It used the openpyxl and xlsxwriter modules. We also have a project I created when I was registered on 
DataCamp. Long ago I was registered on DataCamp, and dabbled in the Pandas and Matplotlib files. Here I just examined a dataset with the Pandas module and made some graphs using 
Matplotlib. Lastly, we have my original Tic-Tac-Toe program here, though it was a prototype with some errors in functionality (when you set difficulty to hard you would win and when 
you set it to easy you would lose). There are repositories here with the object oriented versions of this same code, and with these functionalities fixed to an extent (you still
tie on easy, but I'll go with it).
